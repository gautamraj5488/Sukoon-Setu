  "diabetes" : "1. Diabetes\n\nü©∫ What is Diabetes?\n\n‚Ä¢ Diabetes is a long-term condition where your body has trouble using sugar (called glucose) from your food.\n‚Ä¢ Normally, a hormone called insulin helps carry sugar from your blood into your body‚Äôs cells for energy.\n‚Ä¢ In diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or doesn‚Äôt use it well, causing sugar to stay in your blood.\n‚Ä¢ Too much sugar in the blood for a long time can harm your heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves.\n‚ö†Ô∏è Common Symptoms (What People May Feel)\n‚Ä¢ ü•µ Feeling very thirsty often: You may drink more water than usual and still feel dry.\n‚Ä¢ üöΩ Frequent urination: You may go to the toilet more, especially at night.\n‚Ä¢ üò¥ Feeling tired all the time: You might feel sleepy or weak, even after resting.\n‚Ä¢ üëÄ Blurry vision: Your eyesight might suddenly seem less clear.\n‚Ä¢ ‚öñÔ∏è Losing weight without trying: This can happen even when you are eating well.\n‚Ä¢ ü©π Cuts that heal slowly: Small wounds or infections might take longer to get better.\n‚Ä¢ ü¶∂ Numbness or tingling: You may feel pins and needles in your hands or feet.\nüß† Why It Matters\n‚Ä¢ Diabetes doesn't always show symptoms early, but over time it can cause serious health issues.\n‚Ä¢ It increases your risk for heart problems, kidney failure, eye damage, and nerve pain.\n‚Ä¢ If not treated, it may even lead to stroke or limb damage (requiring amputation in extreme cases).\n‚Ä¢ The good news: with lifestyle changes and care, it can be managed well.\n‚úÖ What You Can Do (Precautions and Home Care)\nüçΩÔ∏è Eat Smarter\n‚Ä¢ Avoid sugary snacks and soft drinks: These quickly raise your blood sugar.\n‚Ä¢ Eat more vegetables, whole grains (like brown rice), and fresh fruits: They help control sugar levels.\n‚Ä¢ Reduce oily and fried food: These can lead to weight gain and worsen blood sugar.\n‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt skip meals: Eating at regular times helps maintain balanced sugar levels.\nüèÉ Stay Physically Active\n‚Ä¢ Aim for at least 30 minutes of walking or light activity every day.\n‚Ä¢ Simple activities like cleaning, playing with kids, or doing housework also help.\n‚Ä¢ Physical movement helps your body use insulin better.\nüìâ Manage Your Weight\n‚Ä¢ Even small weight loss (like 5‚Äì10% of your body weight) can make a big difference in sugar control.\n‚Ä¢ Obesity is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes.\nüß™ Monitor & Get Checked\n‚Ä¢ Check your blood sugar if you are over 35, overweight, or if someone in your family has diabetes.\n‚Ä¢ Early testing helps you take action before it becomes serious.\nüö≠ Say No To...\n‚Ä¢ Smoking: It worsens blood flow and can damage your organs faster.\n‚Ä¢ Alcohol: It can increase or suddenly drop blood sugar, both of which are dangerous.\n‚Ä¢ Sugary drinks: Switch to water, buttermilk, or unsweetened tea.\nüßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Mental and Emotional Care\n‚Ä¢ Diabetes can be stressful. You might feel anxious or frustrated about lifestyle changes.\n‚Ä¢ Talk to someone‚Äîfriends, family, or a counselor. You're not alone.\n‚Ä¢ Stress itself can raise blood sugar, so keeping calm really helps.\nüìå When to See a Doctor\n‚Ä¢ If you notice symptoms mentioned above, especially blurred vision, tiredness, or frequent urination.\n‚Ä¢ If you have wounds that don‚Äôt heal or numbness in hands/feet.\n‚Ä¢ For regular sugar testing‚Äîeven if you feel okay.\n"
